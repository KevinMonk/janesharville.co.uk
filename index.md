### Welcome to Jane Sharville's website, the home of individually hand-crafted hats, fascinators and other headwear.

This site showcases the work of Jane Sharville, a milliner who trained at the Janie Lashford School of Millinery and has since built a stylish and varied collection. Our Service for Hats and Fascinators is locally available in Worthing, West Sussex and also particularly from Brighton, Horsham, Crawley, Haywards Heath and Chichester areas of West Sussex. We also are also accessible from East Sussex areas such as Eastbourne, Peacehaven, Lewes & Newhaven.

We are confident that our prices compare very favourably to those of other couture milliners for our individual creations. Whether they are for your special wedding day, mother of the bride, Ascot race days or other special occasions we are sure that you will be entirely satisfied with the quality and price of our creations.
