title: About Me
---

I am a fully qualified member of the institute of certified bookkeepers working from home in the Eastbourne area. Although most of my clients are based in the surrounding area I do provide my services to many other area's of the U.K without the need to travel-thanks to modern technology!

I started my business because of my passion for figures and a desire for spending my spare time dealing with invoices, bank statements and tax!

I understand that not many people start their businesses with a passion for dealing with what they class as mundane boring tasks such as dealing with the day to day running of the accounts side of things, however it is essential that your bookkeeping records comply with current legislation and HMRC requirements, furthermore an organised set of books can help you gauge the profitability of your business and plans for the future.

By using my services you can avoid the cost of an employee but still free up your own time to concentrate on what you do best.
